					I threw a wish in the well <br>
					Don't ask me I'll never tell <br>
					I looked at you as it fell <br>
					And now you're in my way <br>
					I'd trade my soul for a wish <br>
					Pennies and dimes for a kiss <br>
					I wasn't looking for this <br>
					But now you're in my way <br>

					Your stare was holding <br>
					Ripped jeans, skin was showin' <br>
					Hot night, wind was blowin' <br>
					Where you think you're going baby? <br>
				</p>

					Hey, I just met you and this is crazy <br>
					But here's my number, so call me maybe <br>
					It's hard to look right at you baby <br>
					But here's my number, so call me maybe <br>
					Hey I just met you and this is crazy <br>
					But here's my number, so call me maybe <br>
					And all the other boys try to chase me <br>
					But here's my number, so call me maybe. <br>
